Window Detection with YOLO

Overview

This project uses a YOLO-based neural network to detect windows on building facades. The model takes an image as input and returns the same image with bounding boxes and labels indicating detected windows.

Features

Uses a custom dataset for training.

Outputs images with detected windows highlighted.

Utilizes OpenCV and YOLO for object detection.

Installation
